# Multi-Sensor-360-LiDAR-Array
A high-accuracy, budget-optimized 360° LiDAR mapping system built with 3× RPLIDAR sensors (2×A2 + 1×A1M8) fused via Raspberry Pi 4B and Arduino Uno. Achieves ±2cm accuracy across 360° with real-time point cloud generation at 60Hz. Designed for robotics, SLAM, and autonomous mapping within a strict ₹35,000 budget while maintaining professional-grade precision.
